# NBS-LRR Gene Discovery Project

## Introduction

This repository contains materials for a hands-on student assignment in plant genomics. The project focuses on identifying NBS-LRR (Nucleotide-Binding Site-Leucine-Rich Repeat) genes in rice (*Oryza sativa*).

NBS-LRR genes constitute one of the largest and most important families of plant disease resistance (R) genes. They play a crucial role in the plant's innate immune system by recognizing pathogen effector molecules and triggering defense responses. In rice, these genes are often clustered in specific genomic regions and are key targets for breeding disease-resistant varieties.

## Project Goal

Students will apply bioinformatics tools to scan a provided segment of rice chromosome 11 for potential NBS-LRR genes using profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) from the Pfam database.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` – contains the input genomic sequence in FASTA format.
- `results/` – directory where students should place their output files.
- `.github/` – contains pull request template for submission.

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Assignment Issue](#) for detailed instructions.
